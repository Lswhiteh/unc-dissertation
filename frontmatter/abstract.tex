%The word �Abstract� should be centered 2? below the top of the page. 
%Skip one line, then center your name followed by the title of the 
%thesis/dissertation. Use as many lines as necessary. Centered below the 
%title include the phrase, in parentheses, �(Under the direction of  
%_________)� and include the name(s) of the dissertation advisor(s).
%Skip one line and begin the content of the abstract. It should be 
%double-spaced and conform to margin guidelines. An abstract should not 
%exceed 150 words for a thesis and 350 words for a dissertation. The 
%latter is a requirement of both the Graduate School and UMI's 
%Dissertation Abstracts International.
%Because your dissertation abstract will be published, please prepare and 
%proofread it carefully. Print all symbols and foreign words clearly and 
%accurately to avoid errors or delays. Make sure that the title given at 
%the top of the abstract has the same wording as the title shown on your 
%title page. Avoid mathematical formulas, diagrams, and other 
%illustrative materials, and only offer the briefest possible description 
%of your thesis/dissertation and a concise summary of its conclusions. Do 
%not include lengthy explanations and opinions.
%The abstract should bear the lower case Roman number ii (if you did not 
%include a copyright page) or iii (if you include a copyright page).
