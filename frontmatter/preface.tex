{\Large \textbf{PREFACE}}
\end{center}

Prior to entering UNC I had no prior experience working in population genetics. Despite this, I found the aspect of diving headfirst into a completely new area of study exciting, especially in a lab working on cutting-edge machine learning techniques that I had just started to wrap my head around. Five years later, I feel like I know less now than I did at the start, but that tends to be the nature of these things. I can only hope that the contributions I've made will be at least somewhat useful for someone in my shoes down the line.
