This thesis and the work within would not have been possible, or would have been substantially worse, without the help of many people who contributed their time and efforts. \\ \\
First and foremost thank you to Dr. Dan Schrider, who accepted me as is first graduate student despite having no experience in population genetics, for his incredible depth of knowledge and guidance during these past 5 years. KFTC. \\ \\
Thank you to everyone in the Schrider lab, past and present, for being wonderful colleagues, mentors, and friends. \\ \\
Thank you to John Cornett and Cara Marlow, who are some of the nicest and most helpful people I have had the pleasure of knowing, and without whom this time would have been significantly more confusing. \\ \\
And finally thank you to my committee who has provided excellent feedback and guidance throughout this time.
