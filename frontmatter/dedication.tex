To my wife, Christy, for reminding me to have fun when I work too much, despite being the one I work for. \\
To my family, Scott, Julie, Jarret, and Noah, without whom I would have never made it here in the first place. \\
And to my friends, too many to name, who still don't understand what I do but listen to me anyway.
\end{center}
