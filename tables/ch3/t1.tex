Proper\_Pair         & Whether the read pair is mapped in the correct order (first read comes before the second in terms of genome coordinates) \\ \hline

Split                & Is the read non-contiguous (suggesting an insertion within the read itself)                                              \\ \hline
Long\_Insert         & Is the gap between the read pair larger than the 99th percentile of insert lengths across the alignment                  \\ \hline

Parallel\_Read       & Do both reads of the read pair align to the same orientation of the genome                                               \\ \hline
Everted\_Read        & Are the reads in the pair facing away from each other as opposed to towards each other                                   \\ \hline
Orphan\_Read         & Is this read flagged as paired end but the pair does not align to the reference                                          \\ \hline
Read\_Depth         & Normalized read depth between 0-1 scaled to the min/max read depth of all regions sampled                                          \\ \hline
