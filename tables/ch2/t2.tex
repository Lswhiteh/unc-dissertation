\caption[GPU training and approximate RAM usage for the GCN architecture]{GPU training and approximate RAM usage for the GCN architecture. All training times are reported for a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.  RAM estimates were obtained via nvidia-smi while training was running.  For the GCN, batch size in terms of number of input trees varies stochastically due to the variable tree sequence length.}
